# Hello there!

My name is [Zayd Bille](https://twitter.com/SilverHeroK). Right now, I'm a student at Carleton University, doing some various Software Engineering things. This is my homepage which I'll use to host updates on my latest projects and adventures. If that sounds like something that would interest you, take a look around and enjoy your stay!
